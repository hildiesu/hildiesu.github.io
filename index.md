# Favortie CPSC-120L Labs

**Lab 3, part-1**
  
  I liked this lab because we got to calculate a woman and a man’s bmr. This was fun because we first introduced equations into our coding and this was interesting to me because we’ve never done this before. We use simple functions to display messages and receive messages in the terminal. This was also very nostalgic because this lab was so long ago.

**Lab 7, part-2**
  
  This lab was so fun to me, I love the idea of adding a game into code such as the HI-LO lab. This lab though was way more complex than the hi-lo game. We needed way way functions, loops, and problem solving to be able to execute this lab properly. This was my favorite because I also like the game black jack and seeing that we were able to do this lab in a beginner class made me so much more interested in what else I can do with code.

**Lab 12, part-1, part-2**
  
  This lab was so fun to me because there were a lot of things to code and a lot of coding going on. There was part-1 which took a bit longer than part-2. The first part was fun because I was able to problem solve and use everything I’ve learned in this class to create the code. The second part was also fun because mostly everything was the same as the first part but what made it fun was being able to change the code and see the end results. This lab made me really think about how far I’ve came from week 1, not knowing anything about C++ to being able to make pictures move.
